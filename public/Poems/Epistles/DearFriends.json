    "poem": [
      "Dear friends, reproach me not for what I do,",
      "Nor counsel me, nor pity me; nor say",
      "That I am wearing half my life away",
      "For bubble-work that only fools pursue.",
      "And if my bubbles be too small for you,",
      "Blow bigger then your own: the games we play",
      "To fill the frittered minutes of a day,",
      "Good glasses are to read the spirit through.",
      "                                             ",
      "And whoso reads may get him some shrewd skill;",
      "And some unprofitable scorn resign,",
      "To praise the very thing that he deplores;",
      "So, friends (dear friends), remember, if you will,",
      "The shame I win for singing is all mine,",
      "The gold I miss for dreaming is all yours."
